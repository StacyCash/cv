## Profile

Speaker, author and software developer. Stacy has been developing solutions since the mid-1990s in various companies and industries ranging from facilitating contract jobbing to allowing consumers to close a mortgage without the help of a financial adviser – with lots in between.

She has a passion for sharing knowledge: using story telling for sharing her experiences to help teams grow in the ways that they develop software and work together, and performing live coding demonstrations to inspire others to try new technologies.

Stacy has just completed her first book, aimed at helping developers get started building dynamic applications using C#, Azure Functions and Azure Static Web Apps.

For her effort in the community Stacy has been awarded the Microsoft MVP for Developer Technologies since 2020.

## Community Work 2019 to present

Stacy has been working in the community since 2019. Starting with speaking at international conferences and meetups to share experiences and to give demonstrations on new technology she has since also started to help organize conferences and meetups herself.

She also hosts tracks for conferences, helping to energize the audience, introduce speakers and topics and moderate Q&A sessions.

As well as technical topics Stacy also speaks on non technical subjects. She has talks based around mental health, a subject close to her heart and has a passion to help reducing the stigma surrounding that subject.

## Work Experience

### Omniplan BV 2020 - Present

#### Tech Explorer DevOps

* C#, Angular, Blazor
* Azure App Service

Stacy wears several caps at Omniplan.

Passionate about helping teams improve, facilitating code workshops and introducing practices such as TDD, pair programming and advocating use of whatever learning channels individuals finds useful to help them find the next level. 

On a more global scale she is helping create the agile environment that she loves working in, using DevOps to get value to customers with minimum lead time, and moving responsibility for that value to the team (PO, developers, testers, UIX etc.) who are developing it!

Technically, Stacy works with different teams to help implement features, as well as researching new technology that may be used in future iterations and functionality.

On top of this Stacy works closely with the Technical Director to determine the future technical direction of the platform, determining that using Service Orientated Architecture, with a range of WebAPI services using onion architecture for the complex services as well as smaller services using Azure Functions and using Azure Table Storage for data.

For the last 6 months Stacy has started helping Omniplan to get involved in the community, both with her talks and getting more involved in community directly.

### Independer 2006 – 2020

#### Lead Developer

* C#, .Net Framework, ASP.Net
* SQL Server
* Angular JS
* Angular

Courses taken

* Scrum.org Professional Scrum Master I
* Scrum.org Professional Product Owner I

Over the course of 13 years Stacy held several positions at Independer.
The final position was Lead Developer, leading the "execution only" mortgage team technically.

This entailed helping the team improve their technical and trouble shooting skills and encouraging learning new technology and practices.

When there was a disagreement about a technology decision it fell to the lead developer to make the final decision on what we are going to use.

Along with the team, I worked with the product owner to help refine features and devise solutions to problems that the business is encountering. Be that with customers using the website and closing mortgages, or when sending data to external systems and companies.

As lead developer she also collaborated with the other leads, and the technology scouts, on improving the knowledge and practices across the whole department, sharing knowledge and learnings with each other to take back to their teams.

Before leaving I started working to help the teams get into a DevOps mindset, and trying to improve the tooling to support the teams taking responsibility for the whole application life cycle – from design, to deployment, to monitoring not only the health of the application, but with the product owner, also allowing the teams to validate the hypotheses behind the changes being made.

It was during this time that I started my international speaking career, spreading the learnings from these experience with developers around europe.
